        <h1> Adventures in Code-Fu</h1>
        <h2> My HTML Journey from <mark>Chaos</mark> to <mark>Cat Videos</mark></h2>
        <h3> Or,how I accidentally created a self-playing cat video website (and almost lost my sanity) </h3>
    </body>
    </html>
        <p> Armed with boundless <i>enthusiasm</i> and <i> zero coding experience,</i> I embarked on my quest to conquer <mark> HTML.</mark></h4> 
        <br><small> Little</small> did I know my journey would be less <b> "Lord of the Rings"</b> and more <b> "Three Stooges".</b></p> 
        <p> My <ins> first website</ins> lovingly named <b> "Brenda's Blossoming Botique"</b>,resembled a digital <mark> Jackson Pollock</mark> painting
        <br>Tags were <del> scattered</del> like <i> confetti,colors,clashed</i> like a sunset on <mark> Mars</mark> and the navigation system could only be
        <br>described as <b> "whimsical"</b> <sub> (by a very generous browser)</sub>
        <p> Determine to redeem myself, I tackled a <b> " simple"</b> project: <mark> a cat video gallery.</mark> What ensued was <i> hilarious</i>
        <br><sub> (and slightly terrifying)</sub> <ins> ballet of misplaced semicolons,rogue line breaks,</ins> and <ins> images</ins> that danced uncontrollably
        <br><del> across </del> the screen.At one point, my entire website transformed into an <i> auto-playing cat video slideshow,</i> much to
        <br>the amusement <sub> (and slight concern)</sub>of my family.
        <p> After <ins> several meltdowns,countless tutorials,</ins> and <ins> gallons of coffee.</ins> I finally managed to wrangle my code into <i> submission.</i>
        <br>My cat video gallery wasn't exactly <b> "elegant"</b>,but it functuioned <sub> (mostly)</sub>.And hey,at least I learned that even the <mark> clumsiest</mark>
        <br><mark> coder</mark> can create something...<i> interesting.</i>So, here's to <mark> Brenda bloosoming Boutique, <i> the self-playing cat video extravaganza,</i></mark>
        <br>and the <del> never-ending</del> quest to master the art of <mark> HTML!.</mark>
